/* The most common HTTP methods are:
	GET
	POST
	PUT
	DELETE
*/

// POST request:
	 a pot method is used  when the client 
	 wants to send data to the server

/* physical example:

Real-World Analogy: 
Think of POST like filling out a form:
- You fill out information
- Submit it
- Server creates something new with that information

Example 1 - Online Shopping:
1. You: Add items to cart and checkout
   POST /api/orders
   {
       "items": ["milk", "bread", "eggs"],
       "address": "123 Main St"
   }

2. Server: Creates new order
   Response:
   {
       "orderId": "12345",
       "message": "Order confirmed!"
   }
*/ 

// GET request: is typically used to retrieve data from the server

/* physical example:
	after a while you want to check the status of your order
	you go to the website and you look at the status of your order
	you do this by sending a get request to the server
	the server will look up your order in the database and if it exists
	or you are allowed to see that order, it will return the status of your order
	when you browse internet and you see new information, you are getting it from the server by sending a get request
*/

// PUT request: is used to update existing data on the server

/* physical example:
	Now, lets say you are looking at your shopping cart and you notice that you have an item that you don't want and then you realize that you forgot to add milk to your cart

	you can then send a put request to the server to update your cart
	and the server will update this information in the database

	note: like this you are not creating new data, you are updating existing data that the difference between post and put is that post

	so the server will say we haven't shipped this item yet, but we 
	have removed the unwanted item from your cart and we have added milk to your cart, and you will still have the same id for your order with a payment method and everything else
*/

// DELETE request: is used to delete data from the server

/* physical example:
	lets say you want to cancel your order
	you can send a delete request to the server and the server will delete the order from the database and if money has been charged to your account, the server will refund your money
*/

There are so many more http methods, but these are the most common ones

// How do I know which http method to use?

This depend on the server if its an api this typically is documented
in the api documentation

it totally depends on the server what request you need to send what you want to do, read the documentation to find out what request you need to send

all the above was the ideal case the common practice but not always the case some dont follow this practice
