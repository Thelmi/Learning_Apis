// query means to search or to ask a question

// parameter means a value that you can set to refine your search

/* how a a query parameter looks like

https://example.com/search?

A '?' is the indicator for the start of the query parameter

https://example.com/search?name=John

the way that a parameter is written is by specifying a name
and then = sign and then the value (key=value)

the case above, name is the key and John is the value

https://example.com/search?name=John&age=17

if you want to add more parameters, use '&' and then the key and value

two query parameters has been specified in the case above

"?name=John&age=17" this is the query string

*/

things to note:
/*
	1. query parameters are part of the URL
	2. used to send data to the server
	3. sometimes they are optional, but sometimes they are required
	4. the api dictates the names of the parameters
